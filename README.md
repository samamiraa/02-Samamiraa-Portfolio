# 02-Samamiraa-Portfolio

## My portfolio that will house all projects I have completed.

I wanted to prove to myself that I am capable of applying advanced CSS to projects - that was my motivation. To prove that I am understanding how things work. It is essential for every developer to have a portfolio. I built this to showcase to any future employers. CSS styling is important for the aesthetics of any page, it is what the users see. I learned how to make webpages responsive and interactive through CSS alone. I also learned there is still so much to learn.

## Installation

Before creating my CSS style sheet. I created a wireframe to plan out what I wanted my page to look like and then halfway through decided to change what I wanted the end results look like.<br>

## Usage

First way to use the website is the navigation bar in the header. It includes 3 clickable links that will jump down to the corresponding section.<br>

For example if you click the "Contact Me" link<br>
<img width="155" alt="contact me link" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/ff0d1c0b-99bc-4e7c-ad3a-027296da39ed"><br>
Then it will jump down to its corresponding section!<br>

The main way to use my portfolio is each individual card has two clickable links that will take you to other webpages. For example, each image when clicked will take you to that projects deployed live URL. <br>
<img width="435" alt="code refactor card" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/848e3e9d-5fd5-4242-a5b9-bca2a91aac30"><br>
When the image is clicked it redirects you to the live URL seen below.<br>
<img width="1280" alt="code refactor live URL" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/991bcf92-eb44-4f94-9f8d-3791368fe0b3"><br>

At the bottom of each card, there is also a link to go to the repository for that project on Github.<br>
<img width="1280" alt="github repository code refactor" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/4ebfbb00-0926-49e9-9234-9db80bdb9bab"><br>

I added a couple of media queries where when the screen size changes to a certain size, the font color will change.<br>
When the screen size is larger than 992px, it will look like this.<br>

When the screen is between 769px and 992px, it will look like this.<br>
<img width="985" alt="Media Query 992px" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/4d960170-cbfe-407a-800e-ce8e597d2363">
When the screen is less than 768px, it will look like this.<br>
<img width="761" alt="Media Query 768px" src="https://github.com/samamiraa/02-Samamiraa-Portfolio/assets/146762114/d827e851-b21d-4160-9194-4e097fdab693"><br>

Lastly, at the bottom there is a Linked In icon. Once you click it, it will take the user to the developers profesional Linked In page.<br>

I referred to the class materials for a lot of guidance as well. I was able to reverse engineer what certain things did and applied it to where it was needed in my own code. Also, a thank you to my tutor Andrew, who answered my thousands of questions when I was absolutely stumped.

## Features

Because the main items we are showcasing are deployed projects, I wanted the card boxes to glow when the mouse hovered over them like seen below.<br>
